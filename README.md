# Secret Vault DAO

> 🚀 **Next-Generation Privacy-First DAO Treasury Management**

A revolutionary decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform that leverages cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to ensure complete privacy in governance and treasury management.

## 🌟 What Makes Us Different

Unlike traditional DAO platforms, Secret Vault DAO provides:

- **🔐 Zero-Knowledge Governance**: Vote on proposals without revealing your choices
- **💰 Encrypted Treasury Operations**: Manage funds with complete financial privacy
- **🎯 Reputation-Based Power**: Dynamic voting influence based on contribution history
- **⚡ Real-Time FHE Processing**: Instant encrypted computations on blockchain
- **🔗 Multi-Chain Ready**: Built for the future of decentralized governance

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Encryption**: Zama FHEVM for homomorphic operations
- **Wallets**: RainbowKit + Wagmi + Viem integration
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with FHE capabilities

### Privacy Features
- **Encrypted Voting**: All votes processed without decryption
- **Private Proposals**: Treasury amounts remain confidential
- **Secure Reputation**: Member standing calculated privately
- **Anonymous Governance**: Participate without identity exposure

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

```

## 📋 Smart Contract Features

### SecretVaultDAO Contract

The core contract implements:

- **Encrypted Proposals**: Create treasury proposals with FHE-encrypted amounts
- **Private Voting**: Cast votes using homomorphic encryption
- **Reputation System**: Dynamic voting power based on encrypted reputation scores
- **Treasury Management**: Secure fund allocation with privacy guarantees
- **Quorum Requirements**: Configurable voting thresholds

### Key Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `createProposal()` | Create encrypted treasury proposals |
| `castVote()` | Vote on proposals with FHE encryption |
| `executeProposal()` | Execute passed proposals |
| `joinDAO()` | Join the DAO as a member |
| `updateReputation()` | Update member reputation (verifier only) |
